`Operator` is useful for following the runtime playback, and is designed to work well on devices such as phones and tablets.

You can customize an `Operator` view to show titles, notes, and/or a [custom field](/features/custom-fields) of your choice. This allows different operators to highlight the information that is most useful for them.

While this output is designed for busy operators and is completely automated at runtime, you can also allow editing of the chosen [custom field](/features/custom-fields) through a long press or right-click.
