The <mark>Cuesheet</mark> is a view designed for real-time, cross-department collaboration.

Members of your team and other departments can use the cuesheet to follow the runtime and manage their own data with [Custom Fields](/features/custom-fields).

With possibility for granular read and write access, the cuesheet is also a good interface for collaborating with clients when building the rundown. \
You would be able to give users restricted access so they can follow progress or make changes as needed.
