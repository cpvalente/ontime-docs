description: Ontime offers different views as ways of interacting with the data
---

Ontime provides different screens which allow for different types of interactions with the data. These are called views. \
Each view in Ontime focuses on empowering a specific role or achieving a particular task. 

Any device with a browser in the same network can access Ontime's views.

## Available views

Some views are oriented towards your production team to edit and manage the data ([Production views](#production-views)), while others provide non-interactive data to your team backstage ([Backstage views](#backstage-views)) or public ([Public views](#public-views)).
