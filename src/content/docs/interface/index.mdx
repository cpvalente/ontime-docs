## Available views

Ontime offers different interfaces to consume and extend rundown data, these interfaces are designed to support different tasks:

- [Production views](#production-views): interactive views where users can edit the rundown and add information, focusing on detailed and collaborative work
- [Signage views](#signage-views): non-interactive displays that present key parts of the rundown in a clear, accessible way to support quick reference and coordination during the show.

Any device with a browser in the same network can access Ontime's views.

:::note
All views are configurable, allowing users to customise the behaviour and data of each interface. \
The configuration for signage views is saved in the URL for easy bookmarking and sharing.
