## Available views

Ontime offers different interfaces to consume and extend rundown data, these interfaces are designed to support different tasks:

- [Production views](#production-views): interactive views where users can edit the rundown and add information, focusing on detailed and collaborative work
- [Automated views](#automated-views): non-interactive displays that present key parts of the rundown in a clear, accessible way to support quick reference and coordination during the show.

Any device with a browser in the same network can access Ontime's views by reaching to the IP address of the device where Ontime is running and its port. eg.
```
http://<ip-address:port>/editor -> http://192.168.10.1:4001>/editor
```

:::note
All views are configurable, allowing users to customise the behaviour and data of each interface. \
The configuration for automated views is saved in the URL for easy bookmarking and sharing.

### Automated views

Automated views are non-interactive interfaces focusing on displaying the rundown data at different levels of detail. \
These views are meant for unattended (signage) screens without user interaction after setup.
