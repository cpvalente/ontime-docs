description: Control Ontime from vMix
---

The most straightforward way to get Ontime synced with vMix is by using Ontime's [HTTP API](/api/protocols/http), which provides easy access to the apps playback functions

Adapting from [this vMix forum post](https://forums.vmix.com/posts/t7079-http-command-midi) we see that a workflow could look like:

* [ ] Go to **Settings** - **Scripting** and click **Add**
* [ ] Paste the following and **Save**

```vb
' This code creates a POST request to start an event with id 4b044
Dim request As WebRequest
request = WebRequest.Create("http://localhost:4001/playback/start?eventId=4b044")
Dim response As WebResponse

request.Method = "POST"
request.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"

Dim stream As Stream = request.GetRequestStream()
stream.Close()

response = request.GetResponse()
Dim sr As New StreamReader(response.GetResponseStream())

```

:::note
Remember to change `ONTIME-IP` with the IP address of the machine running Ontime, eg: `127.0.0.1` for localhost
:::

From here, you should be able to add the script as needed. Please follow vMix documentation for the next steps
