:::note
Signing the app means a recurring cost, which, we cannot support.\
If you have tips on how to improve this or would like to sponsor the code signing, get in touch [by email](mailto:mail@getontime.no) or open a [ticket in Github](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/issues).
:::

Ontime is unsigned.\
This doesn't affect the quality or reliability of the code, but it does trigger some warnings in the operating system, discouraging you from running the app.


## Windows

In Windows you could see a message like:
```
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognised app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk.
```

To circumvent, click `more` and select `Run Anyway`

## MacOS

In MacOS you could see a message like:

```
Ontime can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer
```

The solution in macOS is different across version. Please refer to the [Apple documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac)


or in newer versions

```
App Is Damaged and Can't Be Opened
```

To circumvent you would need to disable gatekeeper using the `xattr` command in terminal [as discussed here](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/issues/469#issuecomment-1679127804)

## Linux

In Linux you could see a message like:
```
Could Not Display "ontime-linux.AppImage"
```
To circumvent, right-click the AppImage file: `Properties` -> `Permissions` -> `Allow Executing File as a Program`
