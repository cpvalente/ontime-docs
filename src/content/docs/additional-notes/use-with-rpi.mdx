description: Use a Docker image to run Ontime in a Raspberry Pi
---

Ontime is available as a [Docker image](https://hub.Docker.com/r/getontime/ontime), targeting Arm v6 and v7 devices meant explicitly for Raspberry Pis.

This method leverages a lightweight image that runs Ontime server in a headless Raspberry Pi without UI.\
Ontime will be available in the network as usual.

## Getting started

* [ ] Install Docker on your Raspberry Pi. Please refer to [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) or Raspberry Pi guides for this step
* [ ] Once Docker is installed, pull the [Ontime image from Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/getontime/ontime) with the command

```bash title="Pull Ontime image"
Docker pull getontime/ontime
```

* [ ] You can now start the image by using the provided Docker compose file or creating your own

```bash title="Start the container"
Docker-compose up -d
```

Ontime is now running in the Pi and accessible through the local network on the port indicated in the docker-compose.

Documentation for the Docker process can be [found with the image in Dockerhub](https://hub.Docker.com/r/getontime/ontime).
