title: Poll Ontime
description: Poll Ontime status
---

We offer a poll API which will return the current state of Ontime.
This API is available in all APIs: [HTTP](/api/http), [WebSocket and OSC](/api/osc-and-ws) and will return an example formatted roughly like the below.

:::tip[Show me the code]
This documentation can get out of sync as we add new features to Ontime, [see it directly in the code](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/blob/master/packages/types/src/definitions/runtime/RuntimeStore.type.ts).

    "durationSeconds": 1800,            // duration of current event
    "playback": "start",                // playback status
