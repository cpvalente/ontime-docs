## More

We have been working on Ontime for over 5 years. Over time, we have learned more about how we can make Ontime solve real-world user cases on-site.

The newest release (v4) focuses on improving the user's ability to detail the rundown and leverage timers to make decisions on it. Some highlights:

* [x] Grouped events and timers to the expected and scheduled completion of the running group, allowing better planning.
* [x] Added flags in the rundown to calculate times to any arbitrary upcoming event, improving flexibility.
* [x] Introduced milestone events to add metadata to the rundown for better organization.
* [x] Improved sharing of views with granular read and write permissions for the cuesheet, enhancing collaboration.
* [x] Enabled a single project to contain multiple (non-concurrent) rundowns, increasing project versatility.
* [x] Added more auxiliary timers for enhanced functionality.
* [x] Implemented several UI design changes and improvements for a better user experience.

... and many more.
