## Smaller, better, faster, stronger

At the time of writing, Ontime has been four years in the making.Â \
We have learned about the App and what users have been doing with it.

The newest release (v3) focuses on improving the quality of life in the code base, user interfaces, and APIs.

This will be a good step forward in making Ontime friendlier and more powerful and allow us to move forward faster.

Some highlights of the user-facing work:

* [x] Project manager to simplify handling many Ontime project files
* [x] Improvements in delay management and a new offset data point
* [x] Ability to link event times
* [x] User-definable custom fields
* [x] Re-write of the APIs to simplify interacting with Ontime
* [x] Several UI design changes and improvements

... and many more
