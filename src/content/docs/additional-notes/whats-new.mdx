### More

We have been working on Ontime for over 5 years.
Thousands of users are leveraging Ontime in different fields, from streaming to conferences, festivals and churches. \
Ontime is, at this point, an impactful project in the space, empowering users with professional-level tools at no cost.

Over time, we have learned more about how we can make Ontime solve real-world user cases on-site.

The newest release (v4) focuses on improving the user's ability to detail the rundown and leverage timers to make decisions on it. \

- [x] Allow users to group events and keep track of the time to group completion.
- [x] Allow users to create a timer to any upcoming event by leveraging flags.
- [x] Introduce detailing of the rundown by adding of the milestone rundown entry type.
- [x] Improve collaboration and safety with granular read and write permissions for cuesheet share links.
- [x] Improve view configuration and sharing leveraging presets.
- [x] Allow a single project to contain multiple (non-concurrent) rundowns.
- [x] Added more auxiliary timers for enhanced functionality.

... and many more.
