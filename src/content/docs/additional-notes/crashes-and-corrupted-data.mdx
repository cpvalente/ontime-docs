Sometimes things go badly. \
Ontime provides a few fail-safes to protect its runtime.


:::tip[Where are these file?]
The user directory location is dependent on both the operating system and installation. \
You can find the path to the file in the `Editor` -> `Settings` -> `App settings` -> `View settings` where you activate the CSS override.

**For PC users:**\
`AppData/Roaming/Ontime/`

**For Mac users:**\
`Library/Application Support/Ontime/`

**For Linux users:**\
`Home/Ontime/styles/`

From here you will find the `crash` and `corrupt files` directories
:::


## Crash logs
If the Ontime process crashes, we generate a crash log in the user directory.

Send it over to us and we will take a look.

## Recover on bad shutdown
Ontime persists to the machine the major milestones of the runtime. \
If the app detects that it has been shutdown without the proper processes (in the examples of crash or machine shutdown), Ontime will recover the state on the next start.

This means that you can restart Ontime and the app will jump playback to where it should be.

## Refuse corrupt data
Everytime Ontime loads a project, it parses its data to ensure that it is safe to consume at runtime.

If Ontime is to find data that is either corrupt, or does not conform with the expectations, the data will be refused by the parser. \
These are rare occurences but can happen in the case of external software writing to ontime's project, or while upgrading Ontime versions.

To safeguard your data, Ontime creates a copy of the project before the parse and pushes it to a `corrupt files` directory. The parsed file is renamed to include a `(recovered)` label.
