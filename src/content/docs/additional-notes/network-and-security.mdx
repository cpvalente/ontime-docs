Ontime is available to any device in the network.

Use the device's web browser to navigate to the IP address of the computer running Ontime or point your automations to the same IP address.

:::note
In the examples in this documentation we use the default port **4001**. \
This port is configurable by the user.

### Security
Note that Ontime discourages you from exposing the application in a public network. 

You can add a thin layer of protection over some views such as `/editor`, `/cuesheet` and `/op` using the **Pin Code** defined in the **App Settings**.

However, any device in your network is able to send commands to ontime, which can alter its runtime. \
We recommend that **the most significant security control should happen at the network access level**.
