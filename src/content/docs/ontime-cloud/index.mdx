title: ✨Ontime Cloud✨
description: Hosted service for Ontime
---

Ontime is nearing four years of existence. \
Thousands of users are leveraging Ontime in different fields, from streaming to conferences, festivals and churches.
Ontime is, at this point, an impactful project in the space, empowering users with professional-level tools at no cost.

We have been working on a solution to make Ontime accessible to a broader audience and are happy to announce a hosted version of Ontime. We call it ✨Ontime Cloud✨.

## Why Ontime Cloud

The cloud offering is designed to empower users to rely on Ontime anytime. In pre-production phases and when setting up a network infrastructure is not feasible.

Ontime will remain a free, open-source app with no hidden features behind paying tiers. All project files are compatible and transferable across the cloud and local installs.

Ontime is made by a small team of entertainment engineers.\
By adding a paid offering alongside Ontime, we hope to support Ontime's ongoing costs and eventually finance and improve its development capacity.

## How much will it cost?

We currently offer two plans which should fit for different users needs. \
We will review the pricing and plan as we better understand how the service is being used and which tiers could make the most sense. Feedback here is welcome.

### Ontime Cloud PRO
The PRO plan features monthly payments of $20. \
This option provides a simple scheme with predictable expenses and allows short-term commitment. i.e., pay for it when you need it. 

With the base offering, you get:
* 3 x running stages
* Unlimited simultaneous connections
* Unlimited team members

### Ontime Cloud STUDIO
The STUDIO plan features yearly payments of $600. \
The plan is meant for users who cannot be restricted by an amount of stages.

We want to make sure that you can get the most of Ontime Cloud in your workflow and will collaborate with you to tailor dedicated infrastructure that meets your needs.

The proposition is that we set up dedicated infrastructure for the user, effectively removing any need for limits on stages.\ 
As a side effect, users could also get custom domains and improvements in latency.

For this to be viable, we need a longer time commitment, and this subscription is currently priced annually.
