## Why Ontime Cloud

The cloud offering is designed to empower users to rely on Ontime anytime: \
In pre-production phases and when setting up a network infrastructure is not viable.

Ontime will remain a free, open-source app with no hidden features behind paying tiers. All project files are compatible and transferable across the cloud and local installs.

## Subscription tiers?

We currently offer two plans which should fit for different users needs.

### Ontime Cloud PRO

The PRO plan features monthly payments of $20. \
This option provides a simple scheme with predictable expenses and allows short-term commitment. i.e., pay for it when you need it.

With the base offering, you get:

- 3 x running stages
- Unlimited simultaneous connections
- Unlimited team members

### Ontime Cloud STUDIO

The STUDIO plan is a collaboration platform for studios that want to be involved with Ontime's development. \
Asides from removing restrictions on amount of stages, studio accounts would have 1-1 setup and support from Ontime's team, as well as a saying in the development roadmap.

We want to make sure that you can get the most of Ontime Cloud in your workflow.

From the flexible nature of this collaboration, we do not have a fixed pricing here.
