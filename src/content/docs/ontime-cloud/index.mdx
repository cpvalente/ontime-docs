title: ✨Ontime Cloud✨
description: Hosted service for Ontime
---

Ontime is nearing four years of existence. \
Thousands of users are leveraging Ontime in different fields, from streaming to conferences, festivals and churches.
Ontime is, at this point, an impactful project in the space, empowering users with professional-level tools at no cost.

We have been working on a solution to make Ontime accessible to a broader audience and are happy to announce a hosted version of Ontime. We call it ✨Ontime Cloud✨.

## Why Ontime Cloud

The cloud offering is designed to empower users to rely on Ontime anytime. In pre-production phases and when setting up a network infrastructure is not feasible.

Ontime will remain a free, open-source app with no hidden features behind paying tiers. All project files are compatible and transferable across the cloud and local installs.

Ontime is made by a small team of entertainment engineers.\
By adding a paid offering alongside Ontime, we hope to support Ontime's ongoing costs and eventually finance and improve its development capacity.

## How much will it cost?

We offer a single plan with monthly payments of $20.\
This option provides a simple scheme with predictable expenses and allows short-term commitment. i.e., pay for it when you need it. 

With the base offering, you get:
* 3 x running stages
* Unlimited simultaneous connections
* Unlimited team members

We will review the pricing and plan as we better understand how the service is being used and which tiers could make the most sense. Feedback here is welcome.

I am looking forward to hearing the community feedback on the new offering and, either way, to continue improving Ontime.
