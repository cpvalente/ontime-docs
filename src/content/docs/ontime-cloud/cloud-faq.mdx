### What is a Stage

With your **Ontime Cloud PRO** subscription, you get a default of 3 stages. \
Each stage is a slot that allows you to run an instance of Ontime.

This means you can run 3 simultaneous projects, on in each stage. \
All the stages are isolated and have their own projects, passwords, permissions and settings.

### What is the difference between installing Ontime in my machine or using Ontime Cloud

Ontime is a server application. \
When you run Ontime in your laptop or desktop all users in the same network are able to collaborate and use Ontime. \
However, is not always viable to setup a production network in short time. You may also be working with a client in pre-production where there is no such common network.

Ontime Cloud is simply a convenient and cost-effective way to have Ontime running online so that it can be accessed by anyone anywhere.

### How many people can I invite to collaborate on my project

There are no limits!

We want Ontime to be as valuable as possible for your production and believe that it should be open for all your team to leverage.

Ontime does not, and will not have pricing per seat or collaborator.

### Can I use Companion with Ontime Cloud

Yes!

Ontime Cloud supports the same [HTTP and WebSocket API](/api) as Ontime, meaning you can transfer your connections easily. \
The Ontime Companion module also works as expected.

For connecting Companion to Ontime Cloud, please follow [the guide](/additional-notes/companion-module/#connecting-to-ontime-from-ontimes-companion-module).
