After signing up for Ontime cloud, you will get access to a dashboard which allows managing your stages, teams and subscription.

## Manage your stages

![Dashboard stages](../../../assets/ontime-cloud/dashboard-stages.png)

With the Ontime Cloud PRO subscription, you are currently allowed to manage three concurrent stages. \
Each stage is a separate version of Ontime. The stages can be started and stopped at any time.

Once a stage is running, Ontime will generate a link which is unique for every stage. \
This link is public, and anyone with access to this link will be able to access your ontime stage.
