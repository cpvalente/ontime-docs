title: Ontime Timers
description: Planned and expected times
---

Users create the rundown in a pre-production phase, where Ontime can extract schedules and total durations.

At runtime, Ontime overlays the playback over the schedule to provide extra information on the rundown progress. \
In short, we can use the schedule and the current playback to answer questions like:

- how long until "event-x" starts?
- are we running late?

## Expected times and planned times

With these layers of information, Ontime can extract two types of schedule, **planned times** and **expected times**:

**Planned times** would tell you when is your event supposed to start, according to the schedule you have provided \
**Expected times** give an expectation of when Ontime expects the event is able to start. The expected time is calculated using the current offset + the total duration of all upcoming events until that point.

Considering the above screenshot of the Editor overview.

**Countdown to group end**
<div class="tag">1</div> Time until the **planned end** of the Morning session group \
<div class="tag">2</div> Time until the **expected end** of the Morning session group

**Countdown to flag**
<div class="tag">3</div> Time until the **planned end** of the Session 1 flag event \
<div class="tag">4</div> Time until the **expected end** of the Session 1 flag event

**End of rundown**
<div class="tag">5</div> Rundown **planned end** time \
<div class="tag">6</div> Rundown **expected end** time

## Time to anything

With the information of expected and planned times, Ontime can provide an timer to any rundown event.
