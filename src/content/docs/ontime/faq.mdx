## Can I run Ontime in old Intel Apple devices
Yes! Ontime has separate distributions for Intel Silicon and Apple Intel (x64) processors. Make sure to double-check you are downloading the correct version \
Download links can be found in [the website](https://www.getontime.no/).

## How do I shutdown Ontime?
When running the app from the desktop installer, closing Ontime's window does not shutdown the server process.Â \
This is a safety feature to prevent accidental shutdowns.

To completely shutdown Ontime, navigate to `Editor` -> `Settings` -> `Shutdown`.

:::note
Ontime can only be shutdown from the machine it is running in. \
If you are in the correct machine, and still see the disabled button with the warning message, please use the localhost address in the browser or the app window instead.
