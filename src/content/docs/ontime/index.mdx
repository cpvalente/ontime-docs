### For live environments
Ontime is designed for use in live environments.
This guides the application into being flexible and efficiently integrating into different workflows.

### For teams
All information added in Ontime is shared with the production team and other software / hardware in your workflow.
Ontime also improves team collaboration with dedicated views for cuesheets and operators, and for public and production signage.

### Simple infrastructure
All the data is distributed over the network, making its distribution and infrastructure flexible and cheap.
With the availability of the docker image, you can also leverage IT infrastructure to make Ontime available online for your team and clients.
