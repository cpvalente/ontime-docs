Ontime is a community-driven project, all contributions are valuable.
Would you like to discuss an improvement? A new feature?

**Get in touch!**

If you are a developer and would like to contribute with some code, please open an issue to discuss before opening a Pull Request. 
We have also labelled some tasks as [Good First Issue](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), which should give an excellent introduction to the start developing Ontime.

Information about the project setup can be found in the [development documentation](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md).
