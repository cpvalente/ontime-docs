Ontime is a community-driven project, all contributions are valuable. \
Would you like to discuss an improvement? A new feature?

Get in touch [**on Email!**](mailto:mail@getontime.no) or join our [**Discord server!**](https://discord.com/invite/eje3CSUEXm).

If you're a developer looking to contribute code, we ask that you first open an issue for discussion before submitting a Pull Request.

For those new to Ontime development, we've identified some tasks as [Good First Issue](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
These tasks are designed to provide an excellent introduction to our project.

Information about the project setup can be found in the [development documentation](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md).
