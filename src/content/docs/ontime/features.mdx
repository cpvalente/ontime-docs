* [x] Browser-based: distribute data over the network and consume in any device with a Browser
* [x] Different configurable screen types for different tasks
* [x] Collaborative editing
* [x] Send live messages to different screen types
* [x] Differentiate between production (backstage) and public data
* [x] Manage planned and runtime delays
* [x] Rich integrations, robust control and feedback API to increase the value in workflow
* [x] Roll mode: run standalone by using a clock source
* [x] Load rundown from spreadsheets (eg. Excel or Google Sheets)
* [x] URL Aliases: define configurable aliases to ease onsite setup
* [x] Countdown to anything
