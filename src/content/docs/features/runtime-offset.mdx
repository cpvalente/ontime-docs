title: Runtime offset
description: Runtime offset
---

Ontime has two mechanisms for managing and communicating runtime delays.
The delay workflow and offsets.

The `offset` calculates our capacity to finish the current schedule ontime at the present time.\
In combination with `actual start` and `expected end` datasets it gives a good overview over the rundown schedule.

:::note
The offset value can be negative or positive

__Positive__ offset is time delayed\
__Negative__ offset is time ahead

:::


## See the following examples

### We start late and there are no gaps to recover

:::tip
In this case, the offset will indicate a 10 minute deviation.

```
| Runtime                       | Result offset                 |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Time Now: 09:10               | Scheduled start: 09:00        |
| Event A start time: 09:10     | Scheduled end: 10:00          |
| Rundown:                      | Actual start: 09:10           |
| - Event A 9:00 -> 10:00       | Expected end: 10:10           |
| - Event B 10:00 -> 11:00      | Offset: +00:10:00             |
```

### In combination with time-to-end timers

:::tip
Time to end timers always finish ontime by definition, since they count to their finish time regardless of when they were started.
An offset will only be added if the event is in overtime or has user added time.


```
# We started late, but the event is time-to-end

| Runtime                       | Result offset                 |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Time Now: 09:10               | Scheduled start: 09:00        |
| Event A start time: 09:10     | Scheduled end: 10:00          |
| Rundown:                      | Actual start: 09:10           |
| - Event A                     | Expected end: 10:00           |
|   schedule: 9:00 -> 10:00     | Offset: 00:00:00              |
|   type: time-to-end           |                               |
| - Event B                     |                               |
|   schedule: 9:00 -> 10:00     |                               |
|   type: count-down            |                               |
```


```
# The event is time-to-end and we are in overtime

| Runtime                       | Result offset                 |
