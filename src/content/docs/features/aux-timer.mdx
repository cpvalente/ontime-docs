description: Small utility timer

The Auxiliary timer is a feature that allows parallel, free-running clocks alongside the rundown playback. \
These timers do not affect the rundown but serve as an interface for tracking arbitrary events. For example: 
- how long is this section
- countdown to a media playback end time

The Auxiliary timer can be controlled in the [Editor interface](/interface/production/app-editor/) or through one of the APIs (follow docs for [HTTP](/api/protocols/http/#auxiliary-timer), [OSC](/api/protocols/osc/#auxiliary-timer) or [WebSockets](/api/protocols/websockets/#auxiliary-timer)).
