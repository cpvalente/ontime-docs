Ontime provides a Auxiliary Timer.


This currently does not affect the rundown playback, but it means to facilitate users that want to keep track of secondary timers.

ie: 
- how long is this section
- countdown to a media playback end time

The Auxiliary timer is fully controllable using the API, so you could also have other software sync their timers with Ontime.
