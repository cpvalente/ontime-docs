Views meant for signage or data consumption are configurable using URL parameters.

This means you can share a link which includes the complete customisation of a view, and it pairs great with the [aliases feature](/features/url-aliases).

You can open the customisation panel in any supported view via the [View Parameters Editor](add-link) opened using the Pencil button in the interface.
