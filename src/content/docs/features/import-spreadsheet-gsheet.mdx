You can synchronise Ontime to a Google Sheet. \
This is ideal for collaboration or extensive data manipulation.

![Spreadsheet template](../../../assets/screenshots/features/spreadsheet-template.png)
Follow [here][spreadsheet-link] to see the Google Sheet from the screenshot

To enable this feature, you will to need provide Ontime with the necessary permissions.\ 
From there, we can read and write to the Google Sheet spreadsheet.

### Generate Client Secret in Google

You will need to create a token in your Google Account and upload it to Ontime.

:::tip[Create token in Google Cloud Console]
This guide follow the Google documentation at https://console.cloud.google.com
- On the __Google Cloud Console__, __Create a Project__ for the integration.
- In the left menu click `Create Credentials` (or use the link https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials), and select `OAuth client ID`.  \
_NOTE: You may need to configure a consent screen at this point. This is a Google requirement. Follow the instructions on the page._
- Select `TV and Limited Input devices` as the `Application Type`, and give the app a name.
- In the popup modal presented, click `Download JSON` button to download the Client ID secrets. You can also do this later from the interface.
:::

### 2. Authenticate Ontime
With Client ID Ontime can request Google permission to access the data in the spreadsheet.  

- Start the synchronisation process in `Editor` -> `Settings` -> `Data Sources` by clicking the `Synchronise with Google` button
- Upload the client secret downloaded from Google and provide the ID of the sheet to synchronise
- Click the `Connect` button to request the authentication in Google services.

You will be provided a 6 digit code and a link to the Google Authentication page. \
Please follow the link and insert the provided 6 digit code.

:::note[Spreadsheet ID]
The Spreadsheet ID is available in the URL after the `d` attribute:
`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<Spreadsheet ID>/`
:::

### 3. Read and write data
Now Ontime is connected to your Google Sheet.

You can now read and write to and from the spreadsheet in this interface.
Keep in mind that these operations will override the data in the other location

:::note[Client Secret] 
The authentication is kept in memory and wiped when Ontime quits. This means: 
1. We do not keep any sensitive data where others can find it 
2. You will need to provide this file and authenticate every time you restart Ontime
