Any scheduled event in Ontime (called an event in the app) will contain the following information.

# TODO: add SCREENSHOT

### Timer type
An event timer-type informs Ontime on how the event duration should be calculated

## Security
Note that Ontime discourages you from exposing the application in a public network. 

You can add a thin layer of protection over some views such as `/editor` and `/cuesheet` using the **Pin Code** defined in the App Settings.

However, any device in your network is able to send commands to ontime, which can alter its runtime. We recommend that **the most significant security control should happen at the network access level**.
