description: Inject messages to the Ontime presenter view

You can show any text as a secondary field in the [stage timer](/interface/automated/stage-timer).

![Timer with external data](../../../assets/screenshots/features/timer-external.png)

This external message can be set from the editor interface or [API](#setting-secondary-message-from-api). \
The API's provided by Ontime are ideal for software-to-software communication.

Typical use cases include:
- share non-intrusive information with the speaker eg: a talking point reminder
- show information from another software, such as the title of a playing media asset or its elapsed time

### Setting secondary message from API

The secondary message is great to allow other applications to share data with Ontime.
See the documentation on setting the external message using the [OSC](/api/protocols/osc/#example-change-the-secondary-message-text), [HTTP](/api/protocols/http/#example-change-the-secondary-message-text) or [WebSocket](/api/protocols/websockets/#example-change-the-secondary-message-text) APIs.
