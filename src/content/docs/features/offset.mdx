title: Offset
description: Offset

Ontime has two mechanisms for managing and communicating runtime delays.
The delay workflow and offsets.

The `offset` is calculated as a deviation between the schedule and the runtime so far.\
In combination with `actual start` and `expected end` datasets it gives a good overview over the rundown schedule.

See the following examples:

:::note[We start late and there are no gaps to recover]
The offset calculates our capacity to finish Ontime with the current schedule.\
In this case, the offset will indicate a 10 minute deviation.

```
| Runtime                       | Result offset                 |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Time Now: 09:10               | Scheduled start: 09:00        |
| Event A start time: 09:10     | Scheduled end: 10:00          |
| Rundown:                      | Actual start: 09:10           |
| - Event A 9:00 -> 10:00       | Expected end: 10:10           |
| - Event B 10:00 -> 11:00      | Offset: 00:10:00              |
