Ontime allows importing rundown and project data from a spreadsheet written elsewhere (eg. Excel or Google-Sheets).

Maybe you are trying to import data from Google Sheets?
See the [guide](/features/import-spreadsheet-gsheet)
:::

For a successful import, there are a few conventions to follow.

1. Ontime reads a single worksheet
2. The name of the worksheet and columns are given in the app on import
3. Ontime creates an event for every row on the table
4. All fields in an event (row) are optional. Missing data will be defaulted or calculated as needed
5. The times can be either an Excel time field or a short text entry as described [in the smart entry feature](/features/smart-time-entry) eg: `00:10:15` or `10h15`
6. Any text under a field named **Is Public** will make the event public. We show this as a toggle for simplicity
7. See below the expected data types of the rundown data

## Project data

The Project data can also be defined in the sheet. These fields must have their data on the cell to its right (see screenshot or template).

| Field Name          | Data type |
| :------------------ | :-------- |
| Project name        | Text      |
| Project description | Text      |
| Public URL          | Text      |
| Backstage URL       | Text      |
| Public Info         | Text      |
| Backstage Info      | Text      |

## Rundown

Field names are not case-sensitive. Meaning: both **Event Title** and **event title** would be recognised on import.

| Event Field | Data Type                                               | Notes                                    |
