Ontime allows importing a rundown from a spreadsheet written elsewhere (eg. Excel or Google-Sheets).

![Spreadsheet template](../../../assets/screenshots/features/spreadsheet-template.png)
Follow [here][spreadsheet-link] to see the Google Sheet template in the screenshot.

:::tip[Google Sheets]
Maybe you are trying to import data from Google Sheets?

The data structure is exactly the same and the documentation below relevant, but some extra steps are needed to authenticate Ontime with Google. \
See the [guide](/features/import-spreadsheet-gsheet)
:::

## Importing data

For a successful import, there are a few conventions to follow.

1. Ontime reads a single worksheet
2. You can have as many columns as necessary, Ontime only imports the columns you request
2. The name of the worksheet and columns are given in the app on import
3. Ontime creates an event for every row on the table (see exception in Timer type notes)
4. All fields in an event (row) are optional, Ontime will fill in with default data if necessary
5. The times can be either an Excel time field or a short text entry as described [in the smart entry feature](/quick-tips/smart-time-entry) eg: `00:10:15` or `10m15s`

See below the expected data types of the rundown data

Field names are not case-sensitive: both `Title` and `title` would be recognised on import.

| Event Field  | Data Type                                                                               | Default value      |

:::note[Timer type and skipping import]
The **Timer type** column extends the possible values for timers. 

Where a timer count type can be `count-down` `count-up` `time-to-end` `clock` `count-down`. \
Adding a value `block` to this field, creates a Block event.

Any value added here that is not one of the above (eg: `skip` or `production`), will prompt Ontime to skip importing this row.
::: 

### Custom Fields

Ontime allows importing any amount of [custom fields](/features/custom-fields). \
You will need to provide the title of the relevant columns on import.

For each field provided, Ontime will create a custom field and add the data in the excel table row to the event.
