description: The delay workflow allows adding and controlling running delays in realtime

The delay workflow allows control and communication of schedule delays at runtime. 

:::note[Production data only]
The delay information is only available in production / backstage screens such as [Backstage](/views/backstage), [Cuesheet](/views/cuesheet) and [Operator](/views/operator). \
Allowing you to communicate delays to the production team without it affecting views visible to the public.

No delay information is show in the Public views.

Looking at the image above, we see that a delay event with a value of 15 minutes causes events 6 and 7 to have a delay. The delay is stopped by a block event and event 8 runs as normal.

As shown in the image above, event 6 has been delayed by 15 minutes. This is visible with the _+15_ indication on the left.

The timer also has two indications now, _09:55_ and _10:10_ (for the start time): meaning the original time of 09:55 has been delayed and is now 10:10. The delayed times have a light orange outline

Using **Apply Delay** function (orange button with double chevrons down), we can apply the change in times permanently
