title: The delay workflow REVISE
description: Visibility and control over your runtime delays
---

The delay workflow allows control and communication of schedule delays at runtime. 

:::note[Production data only]
The delay information is only available in production / backstage screens such as [Backstage](/views/backstage), [Cuesheet](/views/cuesheet) and [Operator](/views/operator).

No delay information is show in the Public views.
::::

There are two layers for delay management
- Scheduled delays
- Runtime delays

### Scheduled delays
In Ontime, you are able to schedule delays into your rundown. \
This can be a useful way to communicate to the production team that a certain part of the event is running behind / ahead.

:::note[Delay propagation]
A scheduled delay will propagate through the rundown until it finds a break that cancels it out, or a negative delay (time ahead).

```
1. 12:00 - 18:00 -> Stage setup
+ Delay 5 minutes
2. 18:00 - 18:10 -> Doors open
3. 18:10 - 18:15 -> Stage welcoming
```
::::

A schedule delay is only shown in production views, and can be applied permanently to become part of the schedule by clicking the **Apply Delay** button.

### Runtime delays
Unless your rundown is completely automated, either externally or using the automations built-in with Ontime, there will be a deviation between your schedule the runtime.

Ontime communicates this offset so that you can decide to manipulate the rundown if necessary. \
You could choose to combine this with other features such as skipping events or adding / removing time to ensure the schedule says on track.
