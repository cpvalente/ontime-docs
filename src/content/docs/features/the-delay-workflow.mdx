description: The delay workflow allows adding and controlling running delays in realtime
---

The delay workflow allows control and communication of schedule delays at runtime. 

:::note[Production data only]
The delay information is only available in production / backstage screens such as [Backstage](views/backstage), [Cuesheet](views/cuesheet) and [Operator](views/operator). \
Allowing you to communicate delays to the production team without it affecting views visible to the public.

No delay information is show in the Public views.

## IMAGE

Looking at the image above, we see that a delay event with a value of 15 minutes causes events 6 and 7 to have a delay. The delay is stopped by a block event and event 8 runs as normal.

## IMAGE

As shown in the image above, event 6 has been delayed by 15 minutes. This is visible with the _+15_ indication on the left.

The timer also has two indications now, _09:55_ and _10:10_ (for the start time): meaning the original time of 09:55 has been delayed and is now 10:10. The delayed times have a light orange outline

Using **Apply Delay** function (orange button with double chevrons down), we can apply the change in times permanently
