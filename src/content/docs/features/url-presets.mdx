URL presets allow providing a short name for any Ontime URL.

It serves two primary purposes:

* **Providing dynamic URLs for automation or unattended screens**
* **Simplifying complex URLs**

See more in the [URL Presets Settings](add-link).

### URL Automation

This is useful for cases where we would like a URL to change from Ontime without it being necessary to change the view consumers.

Consider the case of fixed devices, unattended screens or hardware integrations, where access to change the browser URL may be impractical.

:::tip[URL Automation]
We could for create an alias for a specific screen that relates to its role, position or type\
eg: `192.168.10.10:4001/room51`

In Ontime editor we would configure `room51` to be a preset to a view such as `public` or `backstage`. \ 
We could also change the view `room51` represents during the runtime, and all screens in that URL will update accordingly.

### Simplifying complex or lengthy URLs

With the view customisations through URL parameters, the URL can become complex.

Leveraging URL Presets, you can create a simple URL that can encode a view with given styles or configuration.

:::tip[Simple URL]
The custom url `lower?bg=ff2&text=f00&size=0.6&transition=5` could be simply called `mylower` for quickly recalling.
