title: URL Presets
description: Define URL presets to ease onsite setup
---

URL presets are user defined aliases (shortcuts) to Ontime URLs.

URL aliases are configured centrally from the editor settings. This means that these can be changed for all users accessing Ontime from one place, without changes necessary in the other devices.

The configuration for URL Presets can be found in `Editor` -> `Feature Settings` -> `URL Presets`. \
The feature serves two primary purposes:

### Providing dynamic URLs for automation or unattended screens
Consider the case of fixed devices, unattended screens or hardware integrations, where access to change the browser URL may be impractical. \
Any changes to the aliases will be automatically reflected in the devices that are pointed at that URL.

### Managing complex view configurations
We may have specific configurations for operator views or utility screens that we want to manage centrally. \
See example below:


:::tip[Aliases example]
Consider a camera operator that needs an Ontime view with a specific configuration. \
We have configured the view as necessary and it resolves to the following URL:
`http://localhost:4001/op?main=note&secondary=custom-name&hidepast=true`

We may want to manage the configuration in Ontime, so that the camera operator can access the already configured view without needing to concern about the view options.
This is a typical use case for URL Presets.

To achieve this we would need the following steps:
![URL Presets](../../../assets/screenshots/features/url-presets.png)

- Copy the path of the configured URL above (part after the port `op?main=note&secondary=custom-name&hidepast=true`)
- In `Editor` -> `Feature Settings` -> `URL Presets` create a **New Preset**
- Give our preset name (1) (eg: `cam3`)
- Associate the previously copied URL segment (2)

From here, anyone that accesses ontime on the URL `http://localhost:4001/cam3` will be redirected to `http://localhost:4001/op?main=note&secondary=custom-name&hidepast=true`
