description: Control and feedback from Ontime
---

**Integrations** is a feature that allows Ontime to share its data or control other software and hardware in your system. \
The feature can be configured in the `Editor` -> `Settings` -> `Integrations`

### The Ontime lifecycle

While running your event, Ontime will go through a few lifecycle events.\
The integration feature allows you to request a message once that happens.

| Event                 | Description                                                        | 
| :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `On Load`             | Triggered when an event is loaded                                  |
| `On Start`            | Triggered when an event starts                                     |
| `On Pause`            | Triggered when an event is paused                                  |
| `On Stop`             | Triggered when playback is stopped                                 |
| `On Every Second`     | Triggered once a second                                            |
| `On Update`           | Triggered once a second, as long as a timer is running             |
| `On Finish`           | Triggered when a timer passes the 0 mark                           |


:::tip[Example]
If you add a message to the `On Load` lifecycle, eg: `/ontime/loaded-event`,\
a message will be sent to the device configured in OSC settings every time an event is loaded.
:::

### Using variables in integrations

You can embed data from the application runtime in the message using templates `/your-message/{{ontime-data}} {{ontime-more-data}}`

This means that any of the data described in the [Runtime Data](/api/runtime-data) can be sent as part of the message payload.

When the lifecycle event is triggered, Ontime places the updated piece of data in place of the template.

:::tip[Example]

Extending the example above, you could compose a message that sends the index of the loaded event

```
/send-this/loaded-event-{{loaded.selectedEventIndex}}
```

:::note
The template inside the brackets need to reference the same shape as the nesting of the runtime data as described in [Runtime Data](/api/runtime-data). \
Use the  `.` when referencing a subkey

`{{titlesPublic.noteNext}}` \
`{{playback}}` \
`{{timer.current}}`
:::

### Human readable data

The above data defined in runtime data will give you the data from Ontime as consumed in-app.\
For example, all times are in milliseconds.

This is great for software-to-software communications, but it might not be ideal if you want to consume the data yourself.

For these use cases, we have defined a small list of human-readable timer values you can use in your integration messages.\
The usage would look like

| Variable             | Usage                      | Result                                                                |
| :------------------- | :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `human.clock`        | `{{human.clock}}`          | Current clock in `hh:mm:ss`                                           |
| `human.duration`     | `{{human.duration}}`       | Duration of current timer in  `hh:mm:ss`\*                            |
| `human.expectedEnd`  | `{{human.expectedEnd}}`    | Time at which the current event is expected to finish in `hh:mm:ss`\* |
| `human.runningTimer` | `{{human.runningTimer}}`   | Current running timer in `hh:mm:ss`\*                                 |
| `human.elapsedTime`  | `{{human.elapsedTime}}`    | Elapsed time of current timer in `hh:mm:ss`\*                         |
| `human.startedAt`    | `{{human.startedAt}}`      | Time when the current time started `hh:mm:ss`\*                       |

:::note
\* Timer values will return "null" if no event is loaded
