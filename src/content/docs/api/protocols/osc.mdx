The OSC and WebSocket APIs allow for low latency communication to Ontime server.


:::note[Using OSC]
To use the OSC API, you will need to configure the feature in `Editor` -> `Settings` -> `Integrations`.

Due to the nature of the protocol, for getting feedback from OSC you will need to configure a feedback loop in both Ontime and your other software/devices.

You can monitor the messages received using the **Network log** in  `Editor` -> `Settings` -> `Log`.
:::

## Message
The following endpoints allow controlling the messages Ontime sends to the views. \
The payload response is the current state of the message data

### Example: change the external text
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/message/external/text <new-text>
```

## Playback
The following endpoints allow controlling the Ontime's playback.

## Start event

### Start loaded event
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/start
```

### Start event at index
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/start/index <event-index>
```

### Start event with ID
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/start/id <event-id>
```

### Start event with cue
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/start/cue <event-cue>
```

### Start next event
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/start/next
```

### Start previous event
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/start/previous
```

## Pause running timer
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/pause
```

## Load event

### Load event at index
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/load/index <event-index>
```

### Load event with ID
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/load/id <event-id>
```


### Load event with cue
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/load/cue <event-cue>
```

### Load next event
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/load/next
```

### Load previous event
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/load/previous
```

## Reload current event
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/reload
```

## Stop playback
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/stop
```

## Activate Roll mode
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/roll
```

## User added time
### Add time
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/addtime/add <value-in-seconds>
```

### Remove time
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/addtime/remove <value-in-seconds>
```

## Auxiliary timer

Ontime provides an [auxiliary timer](/features/aux-timer) which does not affect the current playback. \
This can be controlled using the API as shown below

### Set auxiliary timer duration
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/auxtimer/1/duration <value-in-seconds>
```

### Set auxiliary timer direction
Auxiliary timer can count up or count down.

#### Set auxiliary timer to count up
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/auxtimer/1/direction count-up
```

#### Set auxiliary timer to count down
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/auxtimer/1/direction count-down
```

### Start auxiliary timer
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/auxtimer/1/start
```

### Pause auxiliary timer
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/auxtimer/1/pause
```

### Stop auxiliary timer
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/auxtimer/1/stop
```
