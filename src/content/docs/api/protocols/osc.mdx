The OSC and WebSocket APIs allow for low latency communication to Ontime server.


:::note[Using OSC]
To use the OSC API, you will need to configure the feature in `Editor` -> `Settings` -> `Integrations`.

Due to the nature of the protocol, for getting feedback from OSC you will need to configure a feedback loop in both Ontime and your other software/devices.

You can monitor the messages received using the **Network log** in  `Editor` -> `Settings` -> `Log`.

## Change event
```bash
/ontime/change/<event-id>/<field> <new-value>
```

The change endpoint allows changing some of the properties of a given event (below). \
The request should contain a patch of the event to be changed, along with the ID of the event to change.

You can change any field in an event using this endpoint. See below a description of expected values.

| Property      | Value type                                                                                                |

:::caution
Changing the properties `skip` `endAction` `duration` `timeStart` `timeEnd` \
cause the rundown to be recalculated and writing to them is therefore throttled
:::

### Example: change title of event
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/change/<event-id>/title <new-value>
```

### Example: change a custom field
The custom field must exist in the project to be accepted by the API. \
See more on [custom fields](/features/custom-fields)

**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/change/<event-id>/custom:<field-name> <new-value>
```

## Message
The following endpoints allow controlling the messages Ontime sends to the timer view. \
The payload response is the current state of the message data.

### Example: change the external message text

**OSC Message**
```bash
# Note that this will set the text, however setting its visibility is a separate operation.
# See below
/ontime/message/external <new-text>
```

### Example: secondary source in the timer view
**OSC Message**
```bash title="Show auxiliary timer as secondary field"
/ontime/message/timer/secondarySource 'aux'
```

**OSC Message**
```bash title="Show external message as secondary field"
/ontime/message/timer/secondarySource 'external'
```

**OSC Message**
```bash title="Hide secondary field"
# Note: The secondary source can be `aux` or `external`, any other value will assign the property to null (ie: off)
/ontime/message/timer/secondarySource 'off'
```

### Example: blackout timer screens
You can remotely blackout every screen that is in the timer view.

**OSC Message**
```bash title="Blackout timer screen"
/ontime/message/timer/blackout true
```

**OSC Message**
```bash title="Disable timer screen blackout"
/ontime/message/timer/blackout false
```

## Auxiliary timer

Ontime provides an [auxiliary timer](/features/aux-timer) which does not affect the current playback. \
This can be controlled using the API as shown below

### Set auxiliary timer duration
