The OSC and WebSocket APIs allow for low latency communication to Ontime server.


:::note[Using OSC]
To use the OSC API, you will need to configure the feature in `Editor` -> `Settings` -> `Integrations`.

Due to the nature of the protocol, for getting feedback from OSC you will need to configure a feedback loop in both Ontime and your other software/devices.

You can monitor the messages received using the **Network log** in  `Editor` -> `Settings` -> `Log`.

## Change event
```bash
/ontime/change/<event-id>/<field> <new-value>
```

The change endpoint allows changing some of the properties of a given event (below). \
The request should contain a patch of the event to be changed, along with the ID of the event to change.

You can change any field in an event using this endpoint. See below a description of expected values.

:::caution
Changing the properties `skip` `endAction` `duration` `timeStart` `timeEnd` \
cause the rundown to be recalculated and writing to them are therefor therefor throttled
:::

### Example: change title of event
**OSC Message**
```bash
/ontime/change/<event-id>/title <new-value>
```

### Example: change a custom field
The custom field must exist in the project to be accepted by the API. \
