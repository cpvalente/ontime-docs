title: Control Ontime
description: OSC / WebSocket / HTTP APIs
---

Ontime has a strong focus on integrations. We want ontime to play well into your workflow.

:::tip[Help us improve]
How could this be better? Let's chat!\
Get in touch on email [mail@getontime.no](mailto:mail@getontime.no) or [open an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/issues).
:::

The OSC and Websocket API allow for low latency communication to Ontime server.\
Both APIs are identical, so it is up to you to choose the most convenient protocol.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!all of them can hit the same endpoints

The [HTTP API](../http) has access to a smaller subset of features.

### OSC / WebSocket / HTTP APIs

:::tip[Show me the code]
Follow [the code](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/blob/master/apps/server/src/controllers/integrationController.ts) for Ontime's integration controller.
