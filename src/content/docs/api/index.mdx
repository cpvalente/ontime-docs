You can leverage one of the available protocols (OSC, WebSocket and HTTP) to automate your worflows with Ontime.\
With possibility for both [controlling Ontime](/api/#control-ontime) or letting [Ontime control third party applications](/api/#get-data-from-ontime).

## Control Ontime
The OSC, Websocket and HTTP API allow for low latency communication to Ontime. \
The APIs for the difference protocols are mostly feature compatible, so it is up to you to choose the most convenient protocol.

You can find the documentation for the individual protocols by following the links
- [OSC](protocols/osc)
- [WebSockets](protocols/websockets)
- [HTTP](protocols/http)

## Get data from Ontime
You can also leverage the **integrations feature** to distribute the runtime data from Ontime or control other software. \
More information is available [in the documentation for integrations](/api/integrations/).
