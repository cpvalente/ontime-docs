## Control Ontime

The OSC and Websocket API allow for low latency communication to ontime server. Both APIs are identical, so it is up to you to choose the most convenient protocol.

The [HTTP API](/api/http) has access to a smaller subset of features, but it can be handy for integration with software such as vMix.

## Control and feedback from Ontime

You can leverage the integrations feature to **distribute Ontime's rundown data** or **control third party applications** on timer events.
[Read the docs](/api/integrations) for more information.
