Ontime broadcasts its state over WebSockets.\
This allows for integrations to sync to the state of the application.

See below a full definition of the data that Ontime holds. \
This data should be used in conjunction with the [Integrations feature](/api/integrations#using-variables-in-integrations).

:::tip[Show me the code]
This documentation can get out of sync as we add new features to Ontime, \
[see the type definition in the code here](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/blob/master/packages/types/src/definitions/runtime/RuntimeStore.type.ts) \
and the instantiation of the ["empty state" here](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/blob/master/apps/client/src/common/stores/runtime.ts)
:::

:::note
Ontime broadcasts messages formatted as below. \
Where the type `Ontime` indicates the type of message, and the payload is a portion of the [Runtime data object](/api/runtime-data/#runtime-data-object)

```ts
// example broadcast message from Ontime
{ type: "ontime", payload: "<runtime-data-object>"}
```

To keep things efficient, Ontime also broadcasts the individual objects in state as they change. \
This allows for smaller payloads and granular updates.
```ts
// ontime sends smaller messages to update subsets of the object
{ type: "ontime-timer", payload: "<runtime-data-object>.timer"}
{ type: "ontime-playback", payload: "<runtime-data-object>.playback"}
{ type: "ontime-eventNow", payload: "<runtime-data-object>.eventNow"}
...
```
