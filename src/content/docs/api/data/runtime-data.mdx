title: Runtime data
description: Runtime data
---

Ontime broadcasts its state over WebSockets.\
This allows for integrations to sync to the state of the application.

See below a full definition of the data that Ontime holds. \
This data should be used in conjunction with the [Integrations feature](/api/integrations#using-variables-in-integrations).

:::tip[Show me the code]
This documentation can get out of sync as we add new features to Ontime, \
[see the type definition in the code here](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/blob/master/packages/types/src/definitions/runtime/RuntimeStore.type.ts) \
and the instantiation of the ["empty state" here](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/blob/master/apps/client/src/common/stores/runtime.ts)
:::

:::note
Ontime broadcasts messages formatted as below. \
Where the type `Ontime` indicates the type of message, and the payload is a portion of the [Runtime data object](#runtime-data-object)

```ts
// example broadcast message from Ontime
{ type: "ontime", payload: "<runtime-data-object>"}
```

To keep things efficient, Ontime also broadcasts the individual objects in state as they change. \
This allows for smaller payloads and granular updates.
```ts
// ontime sends smaller messages to update subsets of the object
{ type: "ontime-timer", payload: "<runtime-data-object>.timer"}
{ type: "ontime-playback", payload: "<runtime-data-object>.playback"}
{ type: "ontime-eventNow", payload: "<runtime-data-object>.eventNow"}
...
```

## Runtime data object
:::note
All times are in milliseconds from midnight.
:::

### ontime-clock
Contains the server wall clock time.
```ts
{
  clock: number
}
````

### ontime-timer
Contains data related to the application timer
```ts
{
  addedTime: number                                         // time added / removed by user
  current: number | null                                    // running countdown
  duration: null                                            // duration of loaded event
  elapsed: null                                             // elapsed time in current timer
  playback: 'play' | 'pause' | 'armed' | 'stop' | 'roll'    // playback state
  startedAt: number | null                                  // time when current timer was started
  expectedFinish: number | null                             // time when current timer is expected to finish
  finishedAt: number | null                                 // time when current timer reached 0
}
````

### ontime-message
Data related to message feature. It contains two message objects:

#### Timer object
Corresponding to the visibility of messages to the [stage timer view](/interface/backstage/stage-timer).

```ts
timer: {
  text: string
  visible: boolean
  blink: boolean
  blackout: boolean
}
````

#### Message object
Corresponding to visibility of [external messages](/features/external-message) (also displayed in the stage timer view).

```ts
external: {
  text: string
  visible: boolean
}
````

### ontime-runtime
Contains data related to the application runtime.
```ts
{
  numEvents: number                                             // number of non-skipped events in rundown
  selectedEventIndex: number | null                             // index of selected event
  offset: number | null                                         // difference between current runtime and schedule
  plannedStart: number                                          // schedule planned start time
  plannedEnd: number | null                                     // schedule planned end time
  actualStart: number | null                                    // actual start time of rundown
  expectedEnd: number | null                                    // time for expected end
}
````


### ontime-auxtimer1
Contains data related to the [auxiliary timer](/features/aux-timer).
```ts
{
  duration: number                                              // total duration of auxiliary timer
  current: number                                               // current value
  playback: 'play' | 'pause' | 'stop'                           // playback state
  direction: 'count-down' | 'count-up'                          // counting direction
}
````
