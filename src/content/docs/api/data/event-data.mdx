| Note                       | User defined note, available in some views                                  |
| Time Start                 | Scheduled start time                                                        |

| Delay                      | Whether there is a delay associated to the event                            |
| Is Public                  | Whether the event is visible in public screens                              |
| Skip                       | Skipped events are ignored by the runtime playback                          |
| Link Start                 | `Internal` whether the start of the event is associated with the previous   |
| Time Danger                | `Internal` second threshold from time end                                   |

| End Action                 | `Internal` defines potential automation for when an event ends              |
| Timer Type                 | `Internal` defines a method for the counting of the running timer           |
| Time Strategy              | `Internal` defines the significant dataset for event duration               |
| Type                       | `Internal`, this will always be `Event`                                     |
| Custom                     | This is an object of user given custom fields associated to the event       |
