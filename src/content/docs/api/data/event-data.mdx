Any scheduled event in Ontime (called an event in the app) will contain the following information. \
All times are in milliseconds.

| Data                       | Note                                                                        |

| Title                      |                                                                             |

| Note                       | User defined note, available in some views                                  |
| Time Start                 | Scheduled start time                                                        |

| Delay                      | Whether there is a delay associated to the event                            |
| Skip                       | Skipped events are ignored by the runtime playback                          |
| Link Start                 | `Internal` whether the start of the event is associated with the previous   |
| Time Danger                | `Internal` second threshold from time end                                   |

| End Action                 | `Internal` defines potential automation for when an event ends              |
| Timer Type                 | `Internal` defines a method for the counting of the running timer           |
| Count to End               | `Internal` whether an event counts to its duration or scheduled end         |
| Time Strategy              | `Internal` defines the significant dataset for event duration               |
| Type                       | `Internal`, this will always be `Event`                                     |
| Custom                     | This is an object of user given custom fields associated to the event       |

### End action
An event end-action refers to automations to the rundown that may occur once an event finishes (reaches 00:00). \
This is unrelated to how the timer is displayed and concerns only to rundown automation.
- `none`: Event will reach 00:00 and continue playing into negative numbers
- `stop`: Event will reach 00:00 and the rundown will stop
- `load-next`: Next event in the rundown will be loaded
- `play-next`: Next event in the rundown will be loaded and started

### Timer type
An event timer-type informs Ontime on how the timer show be presented.
- `count-down`: Ontime will count down the duration of the event
- `count-up` : Ontime will count up from when the event starts
- `clock`: Ontime will display the current clock
- `none`: Ontime will display a placeholder `--:--:--` when this event is playing

### Count to end
Usually Ontime will count to the total event duration, regardless of when it is started.\
The difference is often reflected in offset.

If `count to end` is active, Ontime will instead count down to the events scheduled end, regardless of the start time.Â \
No offset is added unless the event is considered to be in overtime. 

### Time strategy
An event timer-strategy informs Ontime on how to calculate changes to timers when events are linked. \
