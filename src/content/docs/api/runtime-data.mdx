Ontime broadcasts its state over WebSockets (default port 4001).\
This allows for integrations to sync to the state of the application.

See below a full definition of the data that Ontime holds. You would use the [Integrations Feature](/api/integrations) to share these.

:::tip[Show me the code]
This documentation can get out of sync as we add new features to Ontime, [see it directly in the code here](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/blob/master/packages/types/src/definitions/runtime/RuntimeStore.type.ts)
:::

:::note
The broadcast object `payload` is formatted as below, with a type 'ontime' indicating that this is the application state update.

```ts
{ type: "ontime", payload: "see below}
````
