title: Countdown
description: A timer to another any scheduled event

```bash title="Countdown"
https://MY-IP-ADDRESS:4001/countdown           
```

Imagine a case where a particular department in the building needs to keep track of a specific event.  \
eg: An actor in dressing room number 3 needs to know when to enter. No other times are relevant.

Enter `Countdown` view!

:::note
When calling the route `<ontime-ip>:4001/countdown`, you can choose any event in the rundown.

You can also use the direct routes `<ontime-ip>:4001/countdown?event=1` to follow an event by its order in the list or `<ontime-ip>:4001/countdown?eventid=test` to follow a specific event regardless of its position.

This is a great workflow when combined with [URL Presets](/features/url-presets)
