description: Ontime offers different views as ways of interacting with the data
---

Ontime provides different screens which allow for different types of interactions with the data. These are called views. \
Any device with a browser in the same network can access Ontime's views.

## Available views

![Ontime](../../../assets/images/001-ontime-for-all.png)

There are two main types of views available to be used, **Production Views** and **Public Views**. \
Most views are configurable using the [URL Parameter Editor](add-link)

:::note
Ontime is available to any device in the network by navigating in the browser to the IP address of the computer running Ontime.

In the examples below **MY-IP-ADDRESS** should be replaced by the relevant address. \
Mind that we use the **default port 4001** in the examples, this can be changed by the user.
