Ontime allows shortcuts to speed and simplify the time entry.

| `.` `,` `:` and `spaces` can be used as separators between `hh:mm:ss`                                                                  | `1.20.3` `1 20 3` `1:20:03` `1,20,3`    | `01:20:03`                                                  |
| Three numeric fields are read as `hours:minutes:seconds`                                                                               | `1.2.3` `1 2 3` `1:2:3` `1,2,3`         | `01:02:03`                                                  |
| Two numeric fields are read as `hours:minutes`                                                                                         | `1.2` `1 2` `1:2` `1,2,3`               | `01:02:00`                                                  |
| A single numeric field (≤99) is read as `minutes`                                                                                      | `10`                                    | `00:10:00`                                                  |
| A single numeric field (≥100) is separated into `hours` and `minutes`                                                                  | `120`                                   | `01:20:00`                                                  |
| `h` `m` and/or `s` can be used to indicate specific components                                                                         | `1h30s`                                | `01:00:30`                                                  |
| Named numeric fields can overflow                                                                                                      | `90m`                                   | `01:30:00`                                                  |
| The keyword `p` returns the end time of the previous event                                                                             | `p`                                     | `09:00:00` (if previous event finishes at 09:00:00)         |
| Starting a time entry with a + sign, adds the time to the previous event                                                               | `+10m10s   `                            | `09:10:10` (if previous event finishes at 09:00:00)         |
| Leading zeros are not necessary                                                                                                        | `2.2.2` `2 2 2` `2:2:2` `2,2,2`         | `02:02:02                                                   |
| Separators can be used to indicate where zero is omitted                                                                               | `10:` or `:10`                          | `10:00:00` or `00:10:00`                                    |
| Enter a full time-tag without separators. Note that you need 6 digits for this `hhmmss`, otherwise it will be considered as minutes    | `123456`                                | `12:34:56`                                                  |
