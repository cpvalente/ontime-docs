title: Headless Ontime
description: Running Ontime in a headless machine
---

You can leverage the headless distributions to run Ontime in a computer without GUI. \
This could be in a local machine part of the venue's installation, a small Raspberry Pi or even a server running in the cloud.

Headless installs are the most lightweight and versatile ways to distribute and install Ontime.

## Using NPM

### Getting started

#### Prerequisites
You will need to have installed the correct version of __node.js__.\
Please check [the app engines declaration](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/blob/master/package.json) for the correct version.

#### Running Ontime
To get Ontime running, all you need to do is install it in your system using your package manager of choice:

Install globally in your system 
```bash
npm install -g @getontime/cli
```

... and run using the installed script
```bash
ontime
```

Or install and run ontime (the installation here is temporary for the duration of the session)
```bash
npx install @getontime/cli
```

Once running, the app will be available in any device on the same network over (default port 4001)

## Using Docker

### Getting started

Install Docker on your machine. \
Please refer to [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) or Raspberry Pi guides for this step

Once Docker is installed, pull the Ontime [image from Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/getontime/ontime) using the command:

```bash
docker pull getontime/ontime
```

You can find an example of docker-compose in the Docker repository to help you get started.Â \
To start ontime with the example docker compose file use the command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```


### Notes on Docker-compose

Considering the example docker-compose below

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  ontime:
    container_name: ontime
    image: getontime/ontime:latest
    ports:
      - "4001:4001/tcp"
      - "8888:8888/udp"
      - "9999:9999/udp"
    volumes:
      - "./ontime-external:/external/"
    environment:
      - TZ=Asia/Singapore
    restart: unless-stopped
```

* `4001:4001/tcp` binds local port 4001 to the same container port. Port 4001 is the default for the UI and is necessary to expose the app. 
* `8888:8888/udp` binds the localhost port 8888 (default for OSC input into the app) to the same in the container, so that it can receive data from the host machine targeted to the loopback interface.
* `8888:8888/udp` binds the localhost port 9999 (default for OSC output from the app) to the same in the container, this allows Ontime to send data out of the container.
* `"./ontime-external:/external/"` expose the internal container directory.
* `TZ=Asia/Singapore` overrides the container timezone.

The variations in the network setup will widely depend on your setup.

### Common questions ðŸš¨

#### Ontime default port
Ontime serves its web pages on port 4001.Â 
In the docker compose example `4001:4001/tcp` exposes this port to the outside so it can be accessed at `http://<ip-address>:4001`. 
Instead, you could use `80:4001/tcp`Â to expose the internal container port 4001 to the outside port 80 (the default for http).
That means your URLs would be slightly simpler since you wouldnt need to provide a port, (eg: `http://<ip-address>/editor` instead og `http://<ip-address>:4001/editor`)

### Volumes
The app interacts with some directories that the user can interact with.
In a docker instance, we need to expose this manually to the container host.
Namely:
- `/external/projects/` contains all of Ontime's project files
- `/external/styles/` contains the user provided CSS Override
- `/external/external/` is a placeholder directory that users can leverage to distribute data through Ontime 

You can bind a single host directory to `/external/` for Ontime to store all its files in, or expose the individual parts to host directories:

```
    volumes:
      - "./ontime-db:/external/projects/"
      - "./ontime-styles:/external/styles/"
      - "./ontime-external:/external/external/"
```

#### Setting the time in the container
Docker containers default to UTC timezone, which you can modify using the `TZ` environment variable.

Setting time in a Docker container is not an operation specific to Ontime. \
See as an example the [following blog post](https://docs.diladele.com/docker/timezones.html), which contains a list of timezones to use in Docker.

#### I can see the UI but no timers will start

Ontime uses WebSockets to transport the time data from the server to the UI. \
It can be the case that you are leveraging the Docker image to run Ontime in a cloud server or a server behind a reverse proxy.

In those cases, it is common that the WebSocket transport needs some additional configuration in the server side. \
See documentation for [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/websocket.html) and [this example guide for Synology](https://mariushosting.com/synology-some-docker-containers-need-websocket/).
