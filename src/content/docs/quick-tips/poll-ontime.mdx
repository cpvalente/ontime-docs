We offer a poll API which will return the current state of Ontime. \
You can use the [HTTP](/api/protocols/http/#get-ontime-runtime-state) or [WebSocket](/api/protocols/websockets/#get-ontime-runtime-state) to get a snapshot of the runtime state as documented in the [runtime data](/api/data/runtime-data) section.
