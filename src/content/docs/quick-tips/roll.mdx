title: Roll Mode
description: Ontime runs on its own
---

Roll allows Ontime to run standalone by using the a given clock source. \
Ontime allows moving from Roll mode (automated playback) to manual playback. 

This means you can use roll mode to automate parts of your event while manually controlling others. \

:::note
Keep in mind that roll mode will always play the first event which schedule matches the current time.
