title: Roll Mode
description: Ontime runs on its own
---

"Roll" is a playback mode allowing Ontime to run standalone using the current clock. \
It can be used independently or in conjunction with manual playback to allow for automated rundown sections.

:::note[Example]
- 12:00 - 17:00 -> Stage setup
- 17:00 - 19:00 -> Dinner
- 19:00 - 19:30 -> Doors
- 19:30 - 20:00 -> Warm up act
- 20:00 - 20:10 -> Main act

In a concert setting, we could have a rundown that includes house and production events. \
In that case, automating parts of the rundown would be desirable since there is no sitting operator for those sections. \
At the show start, we would manually take over the playback to run the timers and their integrations.
:::

### General behaviour
- As long as there are non-skipped events in the rundown, we will always accept Roll mode
- If there are no events in the current time frame, we load the next event and count down to its start
- Roll will always load the first matching event in the current time, this could cause issues if there are multiple days planned or if the rundown is not in order
- Roll mode will automate loading the next event when the current is finished

### Moving from manual playback to Roll
If we go from manual playback to Roll mode, the playback should continue as is. \
There are a few edge cases to consider:
- Roll is disabled if the current event is in overtime
- Roll will maintain the current offset when considering event end / start times. You would need to manage the offset manually
