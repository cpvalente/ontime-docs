description: Render Ontime views in third party apps

It is possible to render the any view of Ontime in a third party software that is currently networked with Ontime. \
This flow would be in any software which can render a HTML page, such as OBS (Open Broadcaster Software), disguise or Touchdesigner.

:::note[Keying views]
In some views, you will have a key parameter which allows you to configure the background colour.\
See [view configuration](/quick-tips/configuring-views).

In all other cases you can make use of the [CSS variables](/features/custom-styling) which provide overrides for the background colour:

```css
:root {
    --background-color-override: #00FF00;
}
```

## Rendering lower thirds in OBS
![Lower thirds in OBS](../../../assets/screenshots/features/obs-lower-thirds.png)

* The options **Shutdown source when not visible** and **Refresh browser when scene becomes active** ensure that the lower third animation play on load / unload
* Remember to clear the CSS to ensure a keyable background (see above)
