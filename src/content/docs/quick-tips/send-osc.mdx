description: Sending OSC (Open Sound Control) from Ontime

You can leverage the [integrations feature](/api/integrations) to send Ontime data to other applications via OSC (Open Sound Control).


## OSC Payload examples
When sending an OSC message, the argument type is not explicitly given by the user but inferred by Ontime.


```
| OSC Payload                   | Parsed type                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1111                          | Int                           |
| 0.1111                        | Float                         |
| test                          | String                        |
| "1111"                        | String                        |
| true                          | True                          |
| false                         | False                         |
```

You can also send multiple, space separated arguments which will be parsed individually.

```bash title="Multiple arguments"
"with space" 1111 0.1111 TRUE FALSE
```

Which would be sent as a single message with the payload

```
| Payload value                 | Parsed type                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 'with space'                  | String                        |
| 1111                          | Int                           |
| 0.1111                        | Float                         |
| true                          | True                          |
| false                         | False                         |
```

:::note
Keep in mind that these rules will also affect [template variables](/api/integrations#using-variables-in-integrations).

We advise wrapping template variables that you want to remain as strings in quotes to avoid unintended payloads of strings being split by their spaces or interpreted as numbers.
