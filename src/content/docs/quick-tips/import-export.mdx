Your data is yours to keep and manage. \
Ontime provides features to allow you to manage your project files, including exporting your data to use somewhere else.

## Export / Import Ontime project files

### Exporting project file
You can export and import project files from the project manager `Editor` -> `Settings` -> `Manage projects`.
The project file is a `JSON` formatted file that includes your Rundown and all the application settings.

### Importing project file
If you are sharing project files across users or projects, you can import a previous `JSON` formatted file in the project manager `Editor` -> `Settings` -> `Manage projects`.

Once a file is imported into Ontime, you can also use `Partial Load` to load only parts of another project into the currently loaded project. \
This is a great way to create preset files that are reusable across your projects.

## Export rundown data to consume elsewhere
You may not be consuming Ontime's data in another Ontime instance. \
In these cases, you would likely want to export just your Rundown since the other data is irrelevant outside the app.

Ontime allows exporting the Rundown of any project to `CSV` format so that it can be consumed by other software and integrated with spreadsheets.

Additionally, you can upload/download directly from a [Google Sheet](/features/import-spreadsheet-gsheet).

### Import rundown data from spreadsheets
You can import your rundown from a spreadsheet (eg. `XSLX` from Excel, Numbers, or Google Sheet).

Read more in the features documentation for [importing from spreadsheet](/features/import-spreadsheet) and [importing from Google Sheet](/features/import-spreadsheet-gsheet).
