title: Managing delays
description: Ontime provides tools to visualise and manage runtime delays
---

Ontime provides mechanisms for managing and communicating runtime delays. \
Namely: [Added time](#added-time), [Scheduled delays](#scheduled-delays) and [offsets](#offset).

## Added time
You can add/remove time from the currently running event from the editor view or through one of the APIs.

This is the simplest form of time / delay management. \
The added time affects the `offset` and `expect end` datasets.

## Scheduled delays

You can add delay blocks to the rundown as with any other event. \
This flow allows communication of schedule delays at runtime. 

All the production and backstage views will see the schedule with the added delays, while the public views will remain with the original schedule.

:::note[Production data only]
The delay information is only available in [production](/interface/#production-views) and [backstage](/interface/#backstage-views) views. \
This allows you to communicate delays to the production team without affecting views visible to the public.

No delay information is shown in the [Public views](/interface/#public-views).
::::

## Offset

The `offset` calculates our capacity to finish the schedule on time. \
In combination with `actual start` and `expected end` datasets, it provides a good overview of the rundown schedule.

:::note
The offset value can be negative or positive \
__Positive__ -> offset indicates time ahead \
__Negative__ -> offset indicates time delayed
:::


#### See the following examples

:::tip[We start late and there are no gaps to recover]
In this case, the offset will indicate a 10 minute `-00:10:00` deviation.

```
| Runtime                       | Result offset                 |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Time Now: 09:10               | Scheduled start: 09:00        |
| Event A start time: 09:10     | Scheduled end: 10:00          |
| Rundown:                      | Actual start: 09:10           |
| - Event A 9:00 -> 10:00       | Expected end: 10:10           |
| - Event B 10:00 -> 11:00      | Offset: -00:10:00             |
```

:::tip[In combination with count to end timers]
Count to end timers - since they count to their finish time regardless of when they were started - always finish on time unless they are in overtime.

This is a useful flow for events that have hard deadlines (eg: doors open or crew call cut time) and can be leveraged to recover runtime delays.
```
# We started late, but the event is time-to-end
| Runtime                       | Result offset                 |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Time Now: 09:10               | Scheduled start: 09:00        |
| Event A start time: 09:10     | Scheduled end: 10:00          |
| Rundown:                      | Actual start: 09:10           |
| - Event A                     | Expected end: 10:00           |
|   schedule: 9:00 -> 10:00     | Offset: 00:00:00              |
|   type: time-to-end           |                               |
| - Event B                     |                               |
|   schedule: 9:00 -> 10:00     |                               |
|   type: count-down            |                               |
```


```
# The event is time-to-end and we are in overtime
| Runtime                       | Result offset                 |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Time Now: 10:10               | Scheduled start: 09:00        |
| Event A start time: 09:10     | Scheduled end: 10:00          |
| Rundown:                      | Actual start: 09:10           |
| - Event A                     | Expected end: 10:10           |
|   schedule: 9:00 -> 10:00     | Offset: -00:10:00             |
|   type: time-to-end           |                               |
| - Event B                     |                               |
|   schedule: 9:00 -> 10:00     |                               |
|   type: count-down            |                               |
